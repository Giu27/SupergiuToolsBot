# SupergiuToolsBot
Bot I made in my free time out of boredom and willingness to learn.

# What does the bot do?
The bot comes with many commands, letting the user change their name in the bot, either by choosing one or getting a random one, send a message to owner and admins, get an historical event from wikipedia, getting a random number or generating a QRcode from text.
Now available bot in Italian and English!

# What can admins do?
The owner of the bot and the admins can see some general info regarding the bot users, ban certain words, send messages to specific users or broadcast to the whole bot, restricts usage of certain commands, edit bot-only users attributes and create commands on the fly.
For debugging purposes the bot logs messages it receives to help me fix it when it occasionaly breaks.

# How can I use the bot code for my own bot?
Clone the repository and add a .env file in root of the repository. The env must contain two variables, BOT_TOKEN and OWNER_ID.
