# SupergiuToolsBot
Bot I made in my free time out of Boredom and willingness to learn at the same time

# What does the bot do?
The bot comes with many commands,letting the user change their name in the bot,either by choosing one or getting a random one, send a message to owner and admins, get an historical event from italian wikipedia, getting a random number or generating a qr code from text.

# What can admins do?
The owner of the bot and the admins can see some general info regarding the bot users, ban certain words from the names user can choose, send messages to specific users or broadcast to the whole bot.
For debugging purposes the bot logs the message it receives to help me fix it when it occasionaly breaks.

# How can I use the bot code for my own bot?
Clone the repository and add a .env file in root of the repository. The env must contain two variables, BOT_TOKEN and OWNER_ID.
